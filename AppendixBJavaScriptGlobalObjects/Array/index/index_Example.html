// Since this property only shows up when arrays are created by Regular Expressions we make a string:

var myString = "This is really bad grammer really. really.";

// Now we perform a match on the word 'really'

var myArray = myString.match(/really/);

// This will give us an array with one element

// Now we write the result, which will be 8

document.write(myArray.index);
